# _.capitalize

## Problem 1

Sometimes you get string data back from the server that isn't formatted well, but you still want to display the data to the user. You can use `_.capitalize` to clean it up and make it look like a sentence.

```javascript

const error = 'an error occurred: user not found.';
console.log(_.capitalize(error));


```
